Originally from the UK, I have been living in China for the past eight years. In 2018, I was admitted to Nanjing University where I am currently pursuing my Master's degree in Software Engineering under the supervision of Professor Xinyu Dai.

Research Interests
======

My research is primarily focused on Natural Language Processing, including works on Grammatical Error Correction, Multi-label Classification, and Automated Essay Scoring.
